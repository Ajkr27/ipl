# 🏏 IPL Match Winner Predictor

This project predicts the winner of an IPL match using Machine Learning. It uses historical IPL match data and Logistic Regression to calculate the winning probabilities. A Streamlit app is built for live prediction based on user input.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib  
- Logistic Regression (Machine Learning)  
- Streamlit (for web app)  
- Google Colab (for model development)  
- GitHub (for version control)

## 📊 Features
- Predicts winning probability for both teams based on real-time match data.  
- Inputs: Batting/Bowling team, Toss winner, Venue, Current score, Wickets, Overs.  
- Interactive web app using Streamlit.  
- Clean and professional GitHub repository with code, visuals, and explanation.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Flow
1. Loaded and cleaned historical IPL data.  
2. Performed feature selection and encoding.  
3. Trained a Logistic Regression model.  
4. Evaluated performance on test data.  
5. Deployed using Streamlit for live prediction.
